# Console Yamb Game
Console Yamb Game is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Yamb game. The game is played in the console, allowing players to roll dice and score points based on various combinations.

> One goal I had in mind was to try out different random number generators ( Linear Congruential Generator, Blum Blum Shub, Lagged Fibonacci Generator...). I stuck with LCG, as I found it the most fitting for this particular problem.
